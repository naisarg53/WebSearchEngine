For content where accuracy and authoritativeness are key, including news, politics, medical, and scientific information, we use machine learning systems that prioritize information from authoritative sources and provide context to help you make informed decisions. Raising authoritative voices There are a lot of signals - such as relevance and popularity - that typically matter when our systems determine what videos to show when you’re searching for content. However, when it comes to news and information, we know that authoritativeness is key. That’s why we’re committed to helping these users discover authoritative sources when it comes to news and information across our platform. Breaking News When a major breaking news event happens in your country, we want to make sure that you are aware and can easily access authoritative information. In those cases the Breaking News shelf appears directly on your homepage. It features relevant videos from authoritative news sources about news events of national importance. *Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries. Breaking News shelf on the homepage during major breaking news events Resources Learn more about Breaking News shelf How does YouTube determine what breaking news is? You may see Breaking News videos on the homepage for events such as large-scale tragedies, natural disasters, and momentous occurrences in national and international politics. In order to highlight breaking news relevant in your country, we rely on Google News to understand what is happening in the world and when a news story is breaking.

A top news shelf on your homepage may also show if you watch or search for news content. The top news shelf will show up regardless of age, and will include relevant content from news sources that follow Google News content policies. *Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries.

Authoritative voices for newsworthy events get prioritized in search results and “Up next?? panels Providing context to help you make informed decisions Context is critical when evaluating information, so we give you context alongside certain search results and videos to help you make your own decisions about the content that you find on YouTube. To do this, we highlight text-based information about certain events, topics, and publishers from third-party sources using information panels across YouTube. Developing News In developing news situations, when high quality video may not be immediately available, we display links to text-based news articles from authoritative sources in YouTube search results. We will also provide a reminder that developing news can rapidly change. We rely on Google News signals to surface this. *Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries. Developing news information panels link to news articles alongside search results during developing news Fact checks Our fact check information panels provide additional context by highlighting relevant, third-party fact-checked articles above search results for relevant queries, so that you can make your own informed decision about claims made in the news. There are many factors that determine whether a fact check information panel will appear for any given search. Most important, there must be a relevant fact check article available from an eligible publisher. And in order to match your needs with the information we provide, fact checks will show when you search for a specific claim. For example, if you search for "did a tornado hit Los Angeles," you might see a relevant fact check article, but if you search for a more general query like "tornado", you may not. Our fact check information panels rely on an open network of third-party publishers and leverages the ClaimReview tagging system. All publishers are welcome to participate provided they follow the publicly available ClaimReview structured data guidelines, and are either part of the International Fact-Checking Network or are an authoritative publisher. *Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries.
