With Ad Settings, we make it easy for you to control what data we use to personalize ads to you. This includes information you’ve added to your Google Account, what we’ve guessed about your interests as a result of your activity, and interactions with other advertisers that partner with us to show ads. For example, we may think you’re a soccer fan because you watched highlights from a recent match on YouTube, or looked up “soccer fields near me?? on Google Search. And if you’ve spent time on a partner advertiser’s site, we may suggest ads based on that visit. When ad personalization is on, you can choose any info – age and gender, an inferred interest, or a previous interaction with an advertiser –to learn more about why it’s being used, turn it off, or deactivate personalized ads altogether. You’ll still see ads, but they’ll most likely be less relevant.
