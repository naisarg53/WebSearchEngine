We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving you controls in the app so you can customize your kids’ experience. You can create individual profiles for each child, decide what content to make available, block videos or channels you don't want your kids to see, set a timer to limit screen time, see recent videos your kids have been watching, and much more. *YouTube Kids is not available in Quebec at this time. Parental controls: Control and restrict what kids can watch on YouTube Kids Resources Learn more about YouTube’s options for families YouTube Kids YouTube Kids is a dedicated app built from the ground up with kids in mind. It was launched in 2015 to give kids a safer, more contained viewing environment. YouTube Kids has content settings that offer three options (Pre-school, Younger, and Older) and parental controls such as a timer to control screen time and the ability to block videos or channels. Content in YouTube Kids is diverse but a much smaller selection of the content on YouTube, selected using a combination of human review, curated playlists from experts, and algorithmic filtering. Parental controls: Control and restrict what kids can watch on YouTube Kids Resources Learn more about YouTube Kids and controls for parents Supervised experience on YouTube beta In 2021, we launched a new choice for parents who have decided their tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account. Parents link their child’s Google Account to their own before granting them access to YouTube, and then choose from content settings that generally align with content ratings for pre-teens and older. The experience looks much like YouTube’s flagship app and website, but with adjustments to the content a child can find and watch, features they can use, default account settings, and ad protections. The experience also works with Family Link, offering additional parental controls to help guide children as they learn, play, and explore online.
