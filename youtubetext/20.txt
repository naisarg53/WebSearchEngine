This is a unique model that empowers Creators to earn money directly on our platform in a variety of different ways, including through placed advertising, merchandise sales, and subscriptions. Resources If you are a Creator, visit our Creator Academy to access helpful creator resources curated for you. Advertising Advertising is the primary way Creators can earn money on YouTube. Advertising revenue is generated when people watch ads that are running on videos. This revenue from ads is shared between YouTube and the Creator - thus empowering Creators to directly profit from their work. Creators must first be eligible for the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) in order to earn money from advertising on their videos and live streams. In keeping with our commitment to responsibility, we view monetization as a privilege and reward only trusted Creators. Resources Learn more about the YouTube Partner Program Alternate monetization sources Over the last few years we’ve introduced several alternate sources of revenue outside of advertising to help eligible Creators monetize their content while connecting with their viewers. As with the case of advertising, Creators and YouTube share revenue from these products.
