About YouTube - YouTube YouTube Experiences Policies and Safety Copyright Brand Resources Press YouTube Experiences Policies and Safety Copyright Brand Resources Press About YouTube Our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share and build community through our stories. Our values are based on four essential freedoms that define who we are. Freedom of Expression We believe people should be able to speak freely, share opinions, foster open dialogue, and that creative freedom leads to new voices, formats and possibilities. Freedom of Information We believe everyone should have easy, open access to information and that video is a powerful force for education, building understanding, and documenting world events, big and small. Freedom of Opportunity We believe everyone should have a chance to be discovered, build a business and succeed on their own terms, and that people—not gatekeepers—decide what’s popular. Freedom to Belong We believe everyone should be able to find communities of support, break down barriers, transcend borders and come together around shared interests and passions.
