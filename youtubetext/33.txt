Deep dives Spotlights Records Deep dives Separated by up to thousands of miles but intimately connected by screens that provide windows into each other’s worlds, Creators have invited viewers to take part in their everyday activities through “with me?? videos for almost a decade. Despite the uncertainty that came with Covid-19, millions of individuals took to YouTube, reminding us all that we can find our way through, together. We started the #WithMe campaign, to encourage folks to do things at home, together. From learning new skills, finding new ways of teaching and learning, together we’ve found new ways to share the uniquely creative ways we are getting through this time— not just as consumers of video, but as human beings trying to find a way together. See how we bring the data behind this trend to life through visualizations and context.
